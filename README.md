# GrandpasVentilator
Open Source ventilator project

CAUTION !!!

This is not an approved medical device. In fact it is
quite dangerous. Let's make it better together.
	
I tried it on myself once and it damn near killed
me. The main problem was when I tried to breathe against it and hood
pressure skyrocketed. For that reason I only use it on a cedar post.
I bought some pressure sensors, accelerometers, and oximeters to make
it safer and support more modes of operation.

Here is an article on ventilation. It shows that the entrainment
betwixt lungs, device, device controller, and brain is very real.
That is one reason weening can be so difficult.

I will add more good technical links on covid and ventilation 
as I find them.

The goal of this open source project is to create a 
design that can be used to build a ventilator from locally
obtainable parts most places in the world. The mechanical
parts can be obtained from any building supply outfit. The 
electronic parts can be found at computer stores and on eBay. 
The software it uses runs on an Arduino Mega and can be 
downloaded for free as source code on github as GrandpasVentilator.

To see the ventilator in operation go to my youtube 
channel "GrandpasRobots". 

For information on how to build the ventilator go to
grandpasrobots.com and follow the links under 'projects'. You
will see some pictures of my prototype. Many of the parts are only
there because of early experiments and need not be included. 
They will be annotated in the pics.

This is my first version of this project. Feel free to
make and submit changes and I will do my best to incorporate them.
In a few weeks when everything is better documented it will be
easier to make and submit changes.

Thanks,

Old Smoky
